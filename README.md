# Scissors ASP

Scissors ASP is the
[AdvancedSlimePaper](https://github.com/InfernalSuite/AdvancedSlimePaper)-based
edition of [Scissors](https://github.com/ScissorsMC/Scissors). It applies
Scissors' exploit and security patches on top of AdvancedSlimePaper while
retaining the Scissors product identity.

AdvancedSlimePaper adds native support for the Slime Region Format. It loads
worlds from compact slime containers instead of region files. Its API and
core modules are included in this build.

## Building

Building requires Git, an internet connection for initial setup, and Java 25.
Gradle can provision the Java 25 toolchain when run with Java 21 or newer.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ScissorsMC/Scissors-ASP.git
cd Scissors-ASP
./gradlew applyAllPatches
./gradlew :scissors-server:createPaperclipJar
```

On Windows, enable Git long-path support before applying patches:

```powershell
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

Then use:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat applyAllPatches
.\gradlew.bat :scissors-server:createPaperclipJar
```

The runnable server is written to
`scissors-server/build/libs/scissors-paperclip-<version>.jar`. The
`scissors-server-<version>.jar` in the same directory is a thin development
JAR and does not include the runtime dependencies required to start the
server.

Contributors can run `./gradlew build` (or `.\gradlew.bat build` on Windows)
to compile all modules and run the test suite. This verification task does not
create the runnable Paperclip JAR.

## Development

Scissors uses
[paperweight](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight) to store changes as Git
patches over a pinned AdvancedSlimePaper commit. Paperweight first applies
Paper and AdvancedSlimePaper, then applies Scissors' API, Paper-server, and
Minecraft patch layers. Generated Paper and Minecraft worktrees are ignored;
edits to existing upstream code must be committed or folded into the
appropriate nested patch repository, then rebuilt into tracked patch files.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before contributing. It defines the patch workflow,
Git boundaries, the Scissors/AdvancedSlimePaper/Paper naming boundary, and
required verification.

## Version branches and publishing

Use `master` for the latest Minecraft version.
Keep older versions on `ver/<mcVersion>` branches, such as `ver/26.2`.
Before you update `master` to a new Minecraft version, create the older
version branch from the last commit for that version. Include the version-branch
workflow changes in both branches.

Pushes to `master` and `ver/*` in `ScissorsMC/Scissors-ASP` run the full publishing
pipeline: allocate a build number, apply patches, run the build and tests,
create the Paperclip JAR, and publish to Fill. Other branches and fork pull
requests run build checks without publishing.

On a version branch, keep `mcVersion` in `gradle.properties` equal to the
version in the branch name. The workflow checks this before allocating a build
number. Build numbers use the `scissors-asp-<mcVersion>` track. Fill versions also
use `mcVersion`, so each Minecraft version has separate builds. Keep the
matching `apiVersion`, `paperApiVersion`, ASP pin, and build requirements on each branch.

The GitHub `fill` environment must allow the `master` and `ver/*` branch
patterns. It holds the publishing secrets. Keep feature branches and tags out
of this environment. Review the live environment rules before you change them.
